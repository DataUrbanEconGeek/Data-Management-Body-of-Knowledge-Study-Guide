"],["data-management.html", "Chapter 2 Data Management 2.1 Essential Concepts 2.2 Data Management Frameworks 2.3 DAMA and the DMBOK", " Chapter 2 Data Management Gaining value from data requires intention, planning, coordination and commitment. Both management and leadership are needed to treat data as a vital enterprise asset. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Data Management is the development, execution, and supervision of plans, policies, programs, and practices that deliver, control, protect, and enhance the value of data and information assets through their life-cycles. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Data Management Professional is any person who works in any facet of data management to meet strategic organizational goals. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Data management activities are wide-ranging, including the ability to make consistent decisions about how to get strategic value from data to the technical deployment and performance of databases. Both technical and non-technical skills are needed. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.0.1 Business Drivers A key to competitive advantage is information/knowledge. Organizations that have reliable, high quality data about their customers, products, services, and operations can make better decisions than those without data or with unreliable data. Failure to manage data is similar to failure to manage capital. It results in waste and lost opportunity. The primary driver for data management is to enable organizations to get value from their data assets, just as effective management of financial and physical assets enables organizations to get value from those assets. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.0.2 Goals Within an organization, data management goals include: Understanding and supporting the information needs of the enterprise and its stakeholders, including customers, employees, and business partners. Capturing, storing, protecting, and ensuring the integrity of data assets. Ensuring the quality of data and information. Ensuring the privacy and confident of stakeholder data. Preventing unauthorized or inappropriate access, manipulation, or use of data and information. Ensuring data can be used effectively to add value to the enterprise. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1 Essential Concepts Data two definitions: Represents facts about the world. Information that has been stored digitally. Data is a means of representation. We need context for data to be meaningful. Context is data’s representational system, one that includes a common vocabulary and set of relationships between components. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Industry-level data standards can bring more consistency to data. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.1 Data and Information Data is called the raw material of information. Information is data in context. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Information - Data Sales report for last quarter - Data from data warehouse Quarter over quarter performance measures - Quarter’s results Central tenet of data management: Data and information need to be managed, both will be of higher quality if they are managed together with uses and customer requirements in mind. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.2 Data as an Organizational Asset An asset is an economic resource, that can be owned or controlled, and that holds or produces value. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Today’s organizations rely on their data assets to make more effective decisions and to operate more efficiently. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Being data-driven includes the recognition that data must be managed efficiently and with professional discipline, through a partnership of business leadership and technical expertise. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.3 Data Management Principles Data management shares characteristics with other forms of asset management. It involves knowing what data an organization has and what might be accomplished with it, then determining how best to use data assets to reach organizational goals. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Data is an asset with unique properties: Unlike other assets, data is not consumed when it is used. The value of data can and should be expressed in economic terms: Organizations need to develop consistent ways to quantify value of data. Both the costs and low quality data and the benefits of high quality data should be measured as well. Managing data means managing the quality of data: Important to understand stakeholders requirements for quality and measure against these requirements. It takes Metadata to manage data: The data used to manage and use data is Metadata. It takes planning to manage data: To coordinate work and keep the end results aligned requires planning from an architectural and process perspective. Data management is cross-functional; it requires a range of skills and expertise: A single team cannot manage all of an organization’s data. Data management requires an enterprise perspective: Data management has local application, but it must be applied across the enterprise to be as effective as possible. Data management must account for a range of perspectives: Data management must constantly evolve to keep up with the ways data is created and used and the data consumers who use it. Data management is life-cycle management: Data has a life-cycle and managing data requires managing its life-cycle. Different types of data have different life-cycle characteristics: Data management practices have to be flexible enough to meet different kinds of data life-cycle requirements. Managing data includes managing the risks associated with data: Data can be lost, stolen, or misused. Organizations need to consider the ethical implications of their uses of data. Data management requirements must drive Information Technology decisions: Managing data requires an approach that ensures technology serves, rather than drives, an organization’s strategic data needs. Effective data management requires leadership commitment: Data management involves a complex set of processes that, to be effective, require coordination, collaboration, and commitment. Getting there requires not only management skills, but also the vision and purpose that comes from committed leadership. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.4 Data Management Challenges 2.1.4.1 Data Differs from Other Assets: Physical assets can be pointed to, touched, and moved around. They can be in only one place at a time, Financial assets must be accounted for on a balance sheet. Data is different, its not tangible. It’s difficult to put a monetary value on data, but without it, its difficult to measure how data contributes to organizational success. Despite the challenges with measuring the value of data, most people recognize that data has value. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.4.2 Data Valuation: Value is the difference between the cost of a thing and the benefit derived from that thing. For data, this calculation is more complicated, because neither the costs nor the benefits of data are standardized. A primary challenge to data asset valuation is that the value of data is contextual. In relation to data management, establishing ways to associate ways to associate financial value with data is critical, since organizations need to understand assets in financial terms in order to make consistent decisions. Putting value on data becomes the basis of putting value on data management activities. Asking data management professionals and the stakeholders they support to understand the financial meaning of their work can help an organization transform its understanding of its own data and, through that, its approach to data management. Things to consider for valuing data: Cost of obtaining and storing data. Cost of replacing data if it were lost. Impact to the organization if data were missing. Cost of risk mitigation and potential cost of risk associated with data. Cost of improving data. Benefits of higher quality data. What competitors would pay for data. What the data could be sold for. Expected revenue from innovative uses of data. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.4.3 Data Quality: Ensuring data is of high quality is central to data management. Organizations manage their data because they want to use it. If they cannot rely on it to meet business needs, then the effort to collect, store, secure, and enable access to it is wasted. to ensure data meets business needs, they must work with data consumers to define these needs, including characteristics that make data high quality. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Managing data quality has historically been treated as an afterthought, but the people who want to use the data cannot afford to be dismissive of quality. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) As importantly, poor quality data is simply costly to any organization. Costs come from: Scrap and rework Work-arounds and hidden correction processes Organizational inefficiencies or low productivity Organizational conflict Low job satisfaction Customer dissatisfaction Opportunity costs, including inability to innovate Compliance costs or fines Reputational costs (Mosley and Brackett 2010) The corresponding benefits of high quality data include: Improved customer experience Higher productivity Reduced risk Ability to act on opportunities Increased revenue Competitive advantage gained from insights on customers, products, processes, and opportunities. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) As these costs and benefits imply, managing Data Quality is not a one-time job. Producing high quality data requires planning commitment, and a mindset that builds quality into processes and systems. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.4.4 Planning for Better Data Deriving value from data does not happen by accident. It requires planning in many forms. It starts with the recognition the organizations can control how they obtain and create data. If they view data as a product that they create, they will make better decisions about it throughout its life-cycle. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) These decisions require systems thinking because they involve: The ways data connects business processes that might otherwise be seen as separate. The relationship between business processes and the technology that supports them. The design and architecture of systems and the data they produce and store. The ways data might be used to advance organizational strategy. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.4.5 Metadata and Data Management Metadata describes the data an organization has, what it represents, how it is classified, where it came from, how it moves within the organization, how it evolves through use, who can and cannot use it, and whether it is of high quality. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) The challenge is that metadata is a form of data and needs to be managed as such. Metadata management often provides a starting point for improvements in data management overall. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.4.6 Data Management is Cross-functional Data is managed in different places within an organization by teams that have responsibility for different phases of the data life-cycle. Data management requires design skills to plan for systems, highly technical skills to administer hardware and build software, data analysis skills to understand issues and problems, analytic skills to interpret data, language skills to bring consensus to definition and models, as well as strategic thinking to see opportunities to serve customers and meet goals. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.4.7 Establishing an Enterprise Perspective Managing data requires understanding the scope and range of data within an organization. Data originates in multiple places within an organization. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Different departments may have different ways of representing the same concept. A goal of managing data as to make it fit together in common sense ways so that it is usable by a wide range of data consumers. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.4.8 Accounting for Other Perspectives Knowledge of the potential uses of data enables better planning for the data life-cycle and, with that, for better quality data. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.4.9 The Data Life-Cycle Like other assets data has a life-cycle. Well-managed data is managed strategically, with a vision of how the organization will use its data. A strategic organization will define not only its data content requirements, but also its data management requirements. These include policies and expectations for use, quality, controls, and security; an enterprise approach to architecture and design; and a sustainable approach to both infrastructure and software development. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) The data life-cycle includes processes that create or obtain data, those that move, transform, and store it and enable it to be maintained and shared, and those that use or enhanced, or aggregated. As data is used or enhanced, new data is often created, so the life-cycle has internal iterations that are not shown on the diagram, Data is rarely static. Managing data involves a set of interconnected processes aligned with the data life-cycle. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) The focus of data management on the data life-cycle has several important implications: Creation and usage are the most critical points in the data life-cycles. Data Quality must be managed throughout the data life-cycle. Metadata Quality must be managed through the data life-cycle. Data Security must be managed throughout the data life-cycle. Data Management efforts should focus on the most critical data. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.4.10 Different Types of Data Managing data is made more complicated by the fact that there are different types of data that have different life-cycle management requirements. Data can be classified by type of data or by content or by format or by the level of protection the data requires. Data can also be classified by how and where it is stored or accessed. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 2.1.4.11 Data and Risk Data represents risk: Low quality data leads to bad information. Data can be misunderstood and misused. 2.1.4.12 Data Management and Technology 2.1.4.13 Effective Data Management Requires Leadership and Commitment 2.1.5 Data Management Strategy 2.2 Data Management Frameworks 2.2.1 Strategic Alignment Model 2.2.2 The Amsterdam Information Model 2.2.3 The DAMA-DMBOK Framework 2.2.4 DMBOK Pyramid 2.2.5 DAMA Data Management Framework Evolved 2.3 DAMA and the DMBOK References "],["data-handling-ethics.html", "Chapter 3 Data Handling Ethics 3.1 Business Drivers 3.2 Essential Concepts", " Chapter 3 Data Handling Ethics Ethics are principles of behavior based on ideas of right and wrong. Data handling ethics are concerned with how to procure, store, manage, use, and dispose of data in ways that are aligned with ethical principles.(Mosley and Brackett 2010) Ethics of data handling core concepts: Impact on people Potential for misuse Economic value of data Organizations protect data based largely on laws and regulatory requirements. Data management professionals should recognize that there are ethical reasons to protect data and ensure it is not misused.(Mosley and Brackett 2010) There is an ethical imperative not only to protect data, but also to manage its quality. People making decisions, as well as those impacted by decisions, expect data to be complete and accurate.(Mosley and Brackett 2010) 3.1 Business Drivers Ethics means “doing it right when no one is looking” -W. Edward Demings. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Reducing the risk that data for which the organization is responsible will be misused by employees, customers, or partners is a primary reason for an organization to cultivate ethical principles for data handling. There is also an ethical responsibility to secure data from criminals against hacking and potential data breaches. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Handing data ethically requires organization-wide recognition of the risks associated with misuse of data and organizational commitment to handling data based on principles that protect individuals and respect the imperatives related to data ownership. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 3.2 Essential Concepts 3.2.1 Ethical Principles for Data Respect for Persons: This principle reflects the fundamental ethical requirement that people be treated in a way that respects their dignity and autonomy as human individuals. It also requires that in cases where people have “diminished autonomy”, extra care be taken to protect their dignity and rights. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Do we design information systems in a way that limit autonomy or freedom of choice? Have we considered how processing data may affect people with mental or physical disabilities? (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Beneficence: This principle has two elements: first, do no harm; second, maximizing possible benefits and minimizing possible harms. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Is there a less risky way to meet the requirements of the business need? Is the data handling in question lacking transparency in a way that might hide possible harm to people? (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Justice: This principle considers the fair and equitable treatment of people. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Are people or groups of people being treated unequally under similar circumstances? Does the outcome of a process or algorithm results in effects that disproportionately benefit or harm a certain group of people? is machine learning being trained using data-sets that contain data inadvertently reinforcing cultural prejudices? (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Adding a fourth principle: Respect for Law and Public Interest. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) European Data Protection Supervisor: Future-oriented regulation of data processing and respect for the rights to privacy and to data protection Accountable controllers who determine personal information processing Privacy conscious engineering and design of data processing products and services Empowered individuals 3.2.2 Principles Behind Data Privacy Law Public policy and law try to codify right and wrong based on ethical principles. These principles can also provide a framework for organizational policy. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) In 1980, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established Guidelines and Principles for Fair Information Processing that became the basis for the European Union’s data protection laws. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) OECD’s eight core principles, the Fair Information Processing Standards, are intended to ensure that personal data is processed in a manner that respects individuals right to privacy. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) The OECD principles have since been superseded by by principles underlying the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) The GDPR requires effective governance and documentation to enable and demonstrate compliance and mandates Privacy by Design. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Canadian privacy law combine a comprehensive regime of privacy protection with industry self-regulation. PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) applies to every organization that collects, uses, and disseminates personal information in the course of commercial activities. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) FTC’s focus on Fair Information Processing Principles. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Other focuses for fair information practices include: Simplified consumer choice to reduce the burden placed on consumers The recommendation to maintain comprehensive data management procedure throughout the information life-cycle Do Not Track option Requirements for affirmative express consent Concerns regarding the data collection capabilities of large platform providers; transparency and clear privacy notices and policies Individuals access to data Educating consumers about data privacy practices Privacy by Design 3.2.3 Online Data in Ethical Context There are now emerging dozens of initiatives and programs designed to create a codified set of principles to inform ethical behaviors online in the United States. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Topics Include: Ownership of data The Right to be Forgotten Identity Freedom of speech online 3.2.4 Risks of Unethical Data Handling Practices Misrepresenting facts while creating a veneer of factuality. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) One way to understand the implications of ethical handling of data is to examine practices that most people would agree are unethical. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 3.2.4.1 Timing It is possible to lie through omission or inclusion of certain data points in a report or activity based on timing. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 3.2.4.2 Misleading Visualizations Charts and graphs can be used to present data in a misleading manner. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 3.2.4.3 Unclear Definitions or Invalid Comparisons The ethical thing to do, in presenting information, is to provide context that informs its meaning, such as a clear , unambiguous definition of the population being measured and what is means to be “on welfare.” When required context is left out, the surface of the presentation may imply meaning that the data does not support. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) It is also simply necessary, from an ethical perspective, not to misuse statistics. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 3.2.4.4 Bias Bias refers to an inclination of outlook. Bias can be introduced at different points in the data life-cycle: when data is collected or created, when it is selected for inclusion in analysis, through the methods by which it is analyzed, and in how the results of analysis are presented. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) There are several types of bias: Data Collection for pre-defined result: The analyst is pressured to collect data and produce results in order to reach a pre-defined conclusion, rather than as an effort to draw an objective conclusion. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Biased use of data collected: Data may be collected with limited bias, but an analyst is pressured to use it to confirm a pre-determined approach. Data may even be manipulated to this end. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Hunch and search: The analyst has a hunch and wants to satisfy that hunch, but uses the data that confirms the hunch and does not account for the other possibilities that the data may surface. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Biased sampling methodology: Sampling is often a necessary is often part of data collection. But bias can be introduced by the method used to select the sampling set. It is virtually impossible for humans to sample without bias of some sort. To limit bias, use statistical tools to select samples and establish adequate sample sizes. An awareness of bias in data sets used for training is particularly important. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Context and Culture: Biases are often culturally or contextually-based, so stepping outside that culture or context is required for a neutral look at the situation. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) It is not always possible or even desirable to remove all bias. Business bias against poor customers is a foundational piece to many scenarios built by business analyst. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 3.2.4.5 Transforming and Integrating Data Data integration presents ethical challenges because data is changed as it moves from system to system. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) These ethical risks intersect with fundamental problems in data management, including: Limited knowledge of data’s origin and lineage Data of poor quality Unreliable Metadata No documentation of data remediation history 3.2.4.6 Obfuscation / Redaction of Data Obfuscating or redacting data is the practice of making information anonymous, or removing sensitive information. But obfuscation alone may not be sufficient to protect data if a downstream activity can expose the data. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 3.2.5 Establishing an Ethical Data Culture Establishing a culture of ethical data handling requires understanding existing practices, defining expected behaviors, codifying these policies and a code of ethics, and providing training and oversight to enforce expected behaviors. This process requires strong leadership. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 3.2.5.1 Review Current State Data Handling Practices The purpose of reviewing existing data handling practices is to understand the degree to which they are directly and explicitly connected to ethical and compliance drivers. The deliverable from the review should document ethical principles that underlie the organization’s collection, use and oversight of data throughout the data life-cycle, including data sharing activities. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 3.2.5.2 Identify Principles, Practices, and Risk Factors. The purpose of formalizing ethical practices around data handling is to reduce the risk that data might be misused and cause harm to customers, employees, vendors, other stakeholders, or the organization as a whole. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Principles should be aligned with risks and practices. Practices should be supported by controls. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 3.2.5.3 Create an Ethical Data Handling Strategy and Roadmap This strategy must express both ethical principles and expected behavior related to data, expressed in values statements and a code of ethical behavior. The component pieces of such a strategy include (Mosley and Brackett 2010): Values statements Ethical data handling principles Compliance framework Risk assessments Training and communications Roadmap Approach to auditing and monitoring 3.2.5.4 Adopt a Socially Responsible Ethical Risk Model Projects that use personal data should have a disciplined approach to the use of that data. They should account for (Mosley and Brackett 2010): How they select their populations for study How data will be captured What activities analytics will focus on How the results will be made accessible Within each area of consideration, they should address potential ethical risks, with a particular focus on possible negative effects on customers or citizens. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Organizations need to actively identify potential risks. They also need to protect whistleblowers who do see risks and raise concerns. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 3.2.6 Data Ethics and Governance Oversight for the appropriate handling of data falls under both data governance and legal counsel. Data Governance must set standards and policies for and provide oversight of data handling practices. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) DAMA International’s Certified Data Management Professional (CDMP) certification requires that data management professional subscribe to a formal code of ethics, including an obligation to handle data ethically for the sake of society beyond the organization that employs them. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) References "],["data-governance.html", "Chapter 4 Data Governance 4.1 Activities 4.2 Tools and Techniques 4.3 Implementation Guidelines 4.4 Metrics", " Chapter 4 Data Governance Data Governance is defined as the exercise of authority and control over the management of data assets. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Those that establish a formal Data Governance program exercise authority and control with greater intentionally. Such organizations are better able to increase the value they get from their data assets. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) The Data Governance function guides all other data management functions. The purpose of Data Governance is to ensure that data is managed properly, according to policies and best practices. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Most programs include: Strategy Policy Standards and quality Oversight Compliance Issue management Data management projects Data asset valuation For most organizations, adopting formal Data Governance requires the support of organizational change management, as well as sponsorship from a C-level executive, such as Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or Chief Data Officer. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Organizations becoming data-driven often face cultural challenges. Cultural challenges can derail any strategy. Data Governance efforts need to include a cultural change component, supported by strong leadership. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) To Benefit from data as a corporate asset, the organizational culture must learn to value data and data management activities. Even with the best data strategy, data governance and data management plans will not succeed unless the organization accepts and manages change. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.0.1 Business Drivers Data governance is not an end in itself. It needs to align directly with organizational strategy. The more clearly it helps solve organizational problems, the more likely people will change behaviors and adopt governance practices. Drivers for data governance most often focus on reducing risks or improving processes. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Reducing Risk General risk management Data security Privacy Improving Processes Regulatory compliance Data quality improvement Metadata Management Efficiency in development projects Vendor management It is important to clarify the particular business drivers for data governance within an organization and to align them with overall business strategy. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Data governance is not a one-time thing. Governing data requires an ongoing program focused on ensuring that an organization gets value from its data and reduces risks related to data.. A Data Governance team can be a virtual organization or a line organization with specific accountabilities. To be effective, the roles and activities within data governance need to be well understood. They should be built around an operating framework that functions well in the organization. A data governance program should take into account distinctive organizational and cultural issues and the specific data management challenges and opportunities within the organization. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.0.2 Goals and Principles The goal of Data Governance is to enable an organization to manage data as an asset. To achieve this overall goal a DG program must be sustainable, embedded, and measured. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) The following principles can help set a strong foundation for data governance: Leadership and strategy: Successful Data Governance starts with visionary and committed leadership. Data management activities are guided by a data strategy that is itself driven by the enterprise business strategy. Business-driven: Data Governance is a business program, and, as such, must govern IT decisions related to data as much as it governs business interaction with data. Shared responsibility: Across all Data Management Knowledge Areas, data governance is a shared responsibility between business data stewards and technical data management professionals. Multi-layered: Data Governance occurs at both the enterprise and local levels and often at levels in between. Framework-based: Because data governance activities require coordination across functional areas, the DG program must establish an operating framework that defines accountabilities and interactions. Principle-based: Guiding principles are the foundation of DG activities, and especially of DG policy. Often, organizations develop policy without formal principles - they are trying to solve particular problems. Principles can sometimes be reverse-engineered from policy. However, it is best to articulate a core set of principles and best practices as part of policy work. Reference to principles can mitigate potential resistance. Additional guiding principles will emerge over time within an organization. Publish them in a shared internal environment along with other data governance artifacts. 4.0.3 Essential Concepts Data governance ensures data is properly managed without directly executing data management. Data governance represents an inherent separation of duty between oversight and execution. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.0.3.1 Data-centric Organization A data-centric organization values data as an asset and manages data through all phases of its life-cycle, including project development and ongoing operations. Data is no longer treated as a by-product or process and applications. Ensuring data is of high quality is a goal of business processes. As organizations strive to make decisions based on insights gained from analytics, effective data management becomes a very high priority. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) To become data-centric, organizations need to think differently and recognize that managing data is different from managing IT. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) While each organization needs to evolve its own principles, those that seek to get more value from their data are likely to share the following: Data should be managed as a corporate asset Data management best practices should be incented across the organization Enterprise data strategy must be directly aligned with overall business strategy Data management processes should be continuously improved 4.0.3.2 Data Governance Organization Data governance includes: Legislation-like functions - defining policies, standards, and the Enterprise Data Architecture Judicial-like functions - issue management and escalation Executive functions - protecting and serving, administrative responsibilities Each organization should adopt a governance model that supports its business strategy and is likely to succeed within its own cultural context. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) #### Data Governance Operating Model Types #### Data Stewardship Data Stewardship is the most common label to describe accountability and responsibility for data and processes that ensure effective control and use of data assets. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Data stewardship activities will focus on some if not all, of the following: Creating and managing core Metadata Documenting rules and standards Managing data quality issues Executing operational data governance activities 4.0.3.3 Types of Data Stewards Data Stewards manage data assets on behalf of others and in the best interests of the organization (McGilvray, 2008). Data Stewards represent the interests of all stakeholders and must take an enterprise perspective to ensure enterprise data is of high quality and can be used effectively. Effective Data Stewards are accountable and responsible for data governance activities and have a portion of their time dedicate to these activities. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Formally appointed Data Stewards may by differentiated by their place within an organization, by the focus of their work, or by both. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Types: Chief Data Stewards Executive Data Stewards Enterprise Data Stewards Business Data Stewards A Data Owner Technical Data Stewards Coordinating Data Stewards 4.0.3.4 Data Policies Data policies are directives that codify principles and management intent into fundamental rules governing the creation, acquisition, integrity, security, quality, and use of data and information. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Data policies are global. They support data standards, as well as expected behavior related to key aspects of data management and use. Data policies describe the ‘what’ of data governance, while standards and procedures describe ‘how’ to do data governance. There should be relatively few data policies, and they should be stated briefly and directly. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.0.3.5 Data Asset Valuation Data asset valuation is the process of understanding and calculating the economic value of data to an organization. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) The key to understanding the value of a non-fungible item is understanding how it is used and the value brought by its usage (Redman, 1996). How an organization gets value from customer data can be a competitive differentiator. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Most phases of the data life-cycle involve costs. Data only brings value when it is used. So value comes when the economic benefit of using data outweighs the costs of acquiring and storing it, as well as managing risk related to usage. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Some ways to measure value include: Replacement cost Market value Identified opportunities Selling data Risk cost 4.1 Activities 4.1.1 Define Data Governance for the Organization Data governance is most effective when it is an enterprise effort, rather that isolated to a particular functional area. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.1.2 Perform Readiness Assessment Typical assessments include: Data management maturity Capacity to change Collaborative readiness Business alignment 4.1.3 Perform Discovery and Business Alignment A DG program must contribute to the organization by identifying and delivering on specific benefits. Discovery can also identify opportunities for DG to improve the usefulness of data and content. Business alignment attaches business benefits to DG program elements. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Data quality analysis is part of discover. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Assessment of data management practices is another key aspect of the data governance discovery process. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.1.4 Develop Organizational Touch Points How DG will be perceived by the organization. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.1.5 Develop Data Governance Strategy Deliverable include: Charter Operating framework and accountabilities Implementation roadmap Plan for operational success 4.1.6 Define the DG Operating Framework Consider these areas when constructing an organization’s operating model: Value of data to the organization Business model Cultural factors Impact of regulation 4.1.7 Develop Goals, Principles, and Policies Goals, principles, and policies are typically drafted by either by data management professionals, business policy staff, or a combination, under the auspices of data governance. Next, Data Stewards and management review and refine them. Then, the Data Governance Council conducts the final review, revision, and adoption. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.1.8 Underwrite Data Management Projects The key to promoting initiatives is to articulate the ways they improve efficiency and reduce risk. Organizations that want to get more value from their data to prioritize development of or improvement of data management capabilities. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) The DGC helps define the business case and oversees project status and progress on data management improvement projects. Data management projects may be considered part of the overall IT project portfolio. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.1.9 Engage Change Management Organizational Change Management is the vehicle for bringing about change in an organization’s systems and processes. An organization that is mature in its management of change builds a clear organizational vision, actively leads and monitors change from the top, and designs and manages smaller change efforts. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) A change management program supporting formal Data Governance should focus communications on: Promoting the value of data assets Monitoring and acting on feedback about data governance activities Implementing data management training Measuring the effects of change management on in five key areas: Awareness of the need to change Desire to participate and support change Knowledge about how to change Ability to implement new skills and behaviors Reinforcement to keep the change in place Implementing new metrics and KPIs 4.1.10 Engage in Issue Management Issue management is the process for identifying, quantifying, prioritizing, and resolving data governance-related issues, including: Authority Change management escalations Compliance Conflicts Conformance Contracts Data security and identity Data quality Data governance requires control mechanisms and procedures for: Identifying, capturing, logging, tracking, and updating issues Assignment and tracking of action items Documenting stakeholder viewpoints and resolution alternatives Determining, documenting, and communicating issue resolutions Facilitating objectives, neutral discussions where all viewpoints are heard Escalating issues to higher levels of authority 4.1.11 Assess Regulatory Compliance Requirements 4.1.12 Implement Data Governance It is best to create an implementation roadmap that illustrates the timeframe for and relationship between different activities. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Some DG work is foundational, prioritizing activities in the early stages include: Defining data governance procedures required to meet high priority goals Establishing a business glossary and documenting terminology and standards Coordinating with Enterprise Architecture and Data Architecture to support better understanding of the data and the systems Assigning financial value to data assets to enable better decision-making and to increase understanding of the role that data plays in organizational success 4.1.13 Sponsor Data Standards and Procedures Standards help define quality because they provide a means of comparison. They also offer the potential to simplify processes. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Enforcing standards should promote consistent results from the processes using them. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) DG Standards should be mandatory. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Data standards can take different forms depending on what they describe. The level of detail in data standards documentation depends, in part, on organizational culture. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Data management procedures are the documented methods, techniques, and steps followed to accomplish specific activities that produce certain outcomes and supporting artifacts. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Examples of concepts that can be standardized within the Data Management Knowledge Areas include: Data Architecture: Enterprise data models, tool standards, and system naming conventions Data Modeling and Design: Data model management procedures, data modeling naming conventions, definition standards, standards domains, and standard abbreviations Data Storage and Operations: Tool standards, standards for database recovery and business continuity, database performance, data retention, and external data acquisition Data Security: Data access security standards, monitoring and audit procedures, storage security standards, and training requirements Data Integration: Standards methods and tools used for data integration and interoperability Documents and Content: Content management standards and procedures, including use of enterprise taxonomies, support for legal discovery, document and email retention periods, electronic signatures, and report distribution approaches References and Master Data: Reference Data Management control procedures, systems of data record, assertions establishing and mandating use, standards for entity resolution Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence: Tool standard, processing standards and procedures, report and visualization formatting standards, standard for Big Data Handling Metadata: Standards business and technical Metadata to be captured, Metadata integration procedures and usage Data Quality: Data quality rules, standard measurement methodologies, data remediation standards and procedures Big Data and Data Science: Data source identification, authority, acquisition, system of record, sharing and refresh 4.1.14 Develop a Business Glossary Data Stewards ares generally responsible for business glossary content. Developing and documenting standard data definitions reduces ambiguity and improves communication. Definitions must be clear, rigorous in wording, and explain any exceptions, synonyms or variants. Approvers of terminology should include representatives from core user groups. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Business glossaries have the following objectives: Enable common understanding of the core business concepts and terminology Reduce the risk that data will be misused due to inconsistent understanding of the business concepts Improve the alignment between technology assets and the business organization Maximize search capability and enable access to documented institutional knowledge A business glossary is not merely a list of terms and definitions. Each term will also be associated with other valuable Metadata: synonyms, metrics, lineage, business rules, the steward responsible for the term, etc. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.1.15 Sponsor Data Asset Valuation Data and information are assets because the have or can create value. Today’s accounting practices consider data an intangible asset, much like software, documentation, expert knowledge, trade secrets, and other intellectual property. That said, organizations find it challenging to put monetary value on data. The DGC should organize the effort and set standards for doing so. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Estimate the value of business losses due to inadequate information. Information gaps - the difference between what information is needed and what is available - represents business liabilities. The cost of closing or preventing gaps can be used to estimate of business value of the missing data. From there, the organization can develop models to estimate the value of the information that does exist. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) Value estimates can be build into data strategy roadmap that will justify business cases for root cause solutions to quality issues, as well as for the other governance initiatives. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.1.16 Embed Data Governance In order to deepen the organization’s understanding of data governance in general, its application locally, and to learn from each other, create a Data Governance Community of Interest. This is particularly useful in the first years of governance, and will likely taper off as the DG operations become mature. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.2 Tools and Techniques Data governance is fundamentally about organizational behavior. Before choosing a tool for a specific function, like a business glossary solution, an organization should define its overall governance goals and requirements with an eye to build out a tool set. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.2.1 Online Presence / Websites Data Governance program should have an online presence. It can make core document s available via a central website or a collaboration portal. A DG program website should include: The Data Governance strategy and program charter, including vision, benefits, goals, principles, and implementation roadmap Data policies and data standards Descriptions of data stewardship roles and responsibilities Program news announcements Links to forums for a Data Governance Community of Interest Links to executive messages regarding data governance topics Reports on Data Quality measurements Procedures for issue identification and escalation Links to request services or capture issues Documents, presentations, and training programs with links to related online resources Data Governance program contact information 4.2.2 Business Glossary 4.2.3 Workflow Tools 4.2.4 Document Management Tools 4.2.5 Data Governance Scorecards 4.3 Implementation Guidelines Most roll-out strategies are incremental, either applying DG first to a large effort, such as MDM, or by a region or division. Rarely is DG deployed enterprise-wide as a first effort. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.3.1 Organization and Culture Effective and long-lasting data governance programs require a cultural shift in organizational thinking and behavior about data, as well as an ongoing program of change management to support the new thinking, behaviors, policies, and processes to achieve the desired future state of behavior around data. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) The target of organization change is sustainability. Sustainability is a quality of a process that measures how easy it is for the process to continue to add value. Sustaining a data governance program requires planning for change. (Mosley and Brackett 2010) 4.3.2 Adjustment and Communication Tools required to manage and communicate changes: Business / DG strategy map DG roadmap Ongoing business case for DG DG metrics 4.4 Metrics References "],["data-architecture.html", "Chapter 5 Data Architecture", " Chapter 5 Data Architecture In general, architecture refers to an organized arrangement of component elements intended to optimize the function, performance, feasibility, cost, and aesthetics of an overall structure or system. One reason architectural frameworks are valuable is that they enable non-architects to understand relationships. Well-managed enterprise architecture practices help organizations understand the current state of their systems, promote desirable change toward future state,, enable regulatory compliance, and improve effectiveness. Focus of this section: Data Architecture outcomes Data Architecture activities Data Architecture behavior Data architecture is fundamental to data management. Because most organizations have more data than individual people can comprehend, it is necessary to represent organizational data at different levels of abstraction so that it can be understood and management can make decisions about it. The most detailed data architecture design document is a formal enterprise data model, containing data names, comprehensive data and Metadata definitions, conceptual and logical entities and relationships and business rules. Data architecture is most valuable when it fully supports the needs of the entire enterprise. Enterprise Data architecture enables consistent data standardization and integration across the enterprise. Forward-looking organizations should include data management professionals when they are designing new market offerings, because nowadays these usually include hardware, software, and services that capture data, depend on data access, or both.
